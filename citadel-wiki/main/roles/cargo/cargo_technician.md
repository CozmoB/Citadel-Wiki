## ![#Crate](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/6/65/GrayCrate.png) Order Up
Your primary function on station is ensuring that the station is well supplied, this is done by dealing with orders from crew members and making sure you've got a steady supply of credits. To take an order from a crew member for a crate will usually involve them walking up to your desk, telling you what they want or using the nearby computer to submit a request (prefered). Once you know what they need, you can aprrove or deny it. If you're unsure if you should order something for someone ask yourself and them a few questions.
* What are they ordering?
* Is it for their department?
* What do they need it for? 
* Does the crate their ordering contain important, dangerous or restricted gear?

Handing out laser rifle crates to the dodgy looking assisstant with a gas mask on is a good way to end up unemployed or worse. If in doubt still, you can always ask the Quatermaster or the head of the department the crew member is ordering from. Once you've taken their order and clicked it on your supply console it'll be added to a list that'll be sent the next time the shuttle is sent from centcomm. You can do this yourself by clicking the button near the top, ensure that no crewmembers are on the supply shuttle before trying to send it off. Once their crate arrives you can hand it over to them, or let them know its arrived. 

## ![#MULEbot](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/2/2f/MULE.gif) Delivery and Disposals
You can get crates and boxes where they need to go without ever leaving your stoop. You can do this with both the MULE bots and the disposals system. To use the MULEbot, drag a crate over to it, then drag the crate onto it to load it on. Open up your PDA and go to the one of the lower options on the main menu, Delivery Bot Control. From here you can send off your MULEbot to deliver its load at a selected destination.

To use the disposals system you'll need to bring your crate to the smaller disposals room near the cargo office, using the wrapper, wrap your crate, then using the Destination Tagger, set where you want the crate to go. Pull the lever and you can watch it get whisked away and off on its journy through the disposals system.
